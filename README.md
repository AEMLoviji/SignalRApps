# SignalRApps

This repo contains MVC project with single Controller named AppController

I have declared 2 different actions to show 2 different ways using signalR
<ul>
 <li>~/app/chat</li>
 <li>~/app/draw</li>
</ul>

First of them is a real chat app and the second one is a drawer app which is using canvas to draw where course pressed and hovered.
